# Harry Potter Chat-Bot:

This Chatbot speaks like Harry Potter! It is a Discord AI Chatbot that was implemented with the [Microsoft DialoGPT conversational model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium?text=Hey+my+name+is+Mariama%21+How+are+you%3F) fine-tuned from multiple Harry Potter movie scripts.
